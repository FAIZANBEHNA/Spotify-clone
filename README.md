<h1>Spotify Clone - Music Player Web App</h1><br><br>
<p>This is a simple web-based music player inspired by Spotify’s UI. I created this project to practice front-end development, especially DOM manipulation, audio control, layout structuring, and UI styling using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a static web application that plays a set of pre-listed songs with features like play/pause, progress tracking, and an intuitive interface.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2><br>
<ul>
  <li>HTML5 – For structuring the web pages and song layout.</li><br>
  <li>CSS3 – For styling the interface using Flexbox, custom fonts (Google Fonts), background images, and responsive elements.</li><br>
  <li>JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – For controlling audio playback, updating the progress bar, and toggling play/pause functionality.</li><br>
  <li>Font Awesome CDN – For using beautiful and responsive icons like play, pause, forward, and backward.</li><br>
</ul>

<h2>How I Made it</h2><br>
<ul>
  <li>Designed the UI layout with HTML and styled it using modern CSS (with custom fonts and background).</li><br>
  <li>Used <audio> in JavaScript to play songs and control playback.</li><br>
  <li>Managed song metadata like name, path, and image with a JS array.</li><br>
  <li>Added JavaScript event listeners for play/pause and progress bar functionality.</li><br>
  <li>Tested it locally and refined the responsiveness of elements.</li> <br>
</ul>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Dynamic playlist rendering from a database or external JSON file</li><br>
  <li>Display real-time song duration and elapsed time</li><br>
  <li>Make it mobile-friendly and fully responsive</li><br>
  <li>Add support for uploading local songs</li><br>
</ul><br><br>
